        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Favorites, acquired state, and custom builds are persisted across launches. Each source (Vanilla / Randomizer Log) keeps its own saved data.</li>
          <li>Build presets are curated from public build guides (Fextralife, YouTube, community guides). They are item checklists, not stat calculators or full route plans.</li>
          <li>Item locations are harvested from the Elden Ring Fextralife wiki and supplemented with manual corrections.</li>
          <li>No network access is needed — the app works fully offline. Wiki links open in your default browser if you choose to visit them.</li>
          <li>The app never contacts a server, telemetry service, or the game itself. All data stays on your computer.</li>
